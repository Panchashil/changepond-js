Javascript: -it is use to add functionality and behavior into webapp.
            -it is interpreted language.
            -it is loosely typed language. 

*there are two ways to use Javascript
1. internal js : in html file we use script and in that script we write js code.
2. external js: first we create a seperate js file and that js file we import in html file by using script tag.

*How to display output in js 
1.document.write(): it will display output on html page. it display output in single line
2.window.alert(): it will generate one popup and display output in it.
3.console.log(): it will gives output in browser console or in terminal.
4.innerHtml(DOM): it allows us to insert data inside an element.

-in Javascript window is global object 
-By using DOM hoe to set,get value from element.
-how to apply style rule to an element  by using DOM 

*function : 
-it is block of code , which is use to perform specific task.
-it will execute only when we call it.

*Thera are mainly two types of function.
1.Predefine function: provided by Javascript
2.User-define function : created by user 

*How to get values from input control 
*how to use onlcick event.

2009(ECMA script-5 ):
2015(ECMA script-6) : 

* Data types in Javascript
there are two types data type 
1.premitive datatype: number,string,boolean,undefine,null.
2.non-primitive datatype: array , object .


*Array : 
-it is use to store multiple values with same datatype in single variable.
-in array values store on index basis.
-array index always start from zero index. 
-array denoted by [] bracket.
-we can access array data outside array by writting arrayName[indexNumber]

* array length: total number of values available in it.
  syntax: arrayName.length  
*array Size : total number of index  
syntax: arrayName.length-1

*Array method

*object data type :
-it is use to store multiple values with different datatype in single variable.
-in object data store in key and value paire formate.
-we can access object data outside for that we write object.keyName.
-object denoted by {}

*how to change object data;
*Array of object 
*how to display arrarty of object data

*How to change src data from img tag 
Task1: toggle image task;
Task2:change multiple images;

*Callback function: passing one function as an argument inside another function is called Callback function.

*settimeOut method: it will call another method only once after perticular time interval.
                    -it takes two parameter 1.Callback function,2.time in millisecond

*setInterval method: it will call another method multiple time after perticular time interval.
                    -it takes two parameter 1.Callback function,2.time in millisecond


*Date and its method 
-if you want to get date and time in web page by using Javascript for that first we have create object of date class.
in Javascript date class return date and time from browser.
syntax:   let dateObj = new Date();

sun=0,mon=1,tue=2......sat=6 
jan=0..............dec=11 

How to set date and time 
let date = new Date(year,month,date,hourse,second,millisecond)

How to create digital clock 

step1: create remote repository
step2: create folder and open in vs code editor and write code in it.
step3: open terminal with option GitBash 
step4: in terminal write 
        git init
step5: configure remote repository with local repository 
        git remote add origin https://github.com/Panchashil/html-css-bootstrap-project.git
step6: comit code 
step7: git push -u origine master

*exponentiation operator : it will return power of any number.
*differance between == and === 
==  : it check only value if values are same then it return true result.
=== : it check both value as well as its datatype if both are same then and only then it return true value.

ex: 5==5 =>true
    '5'==5 =>true
    5===5 =>true
   '5'===5 =>false

*Hoisting : it is Javascript default behavior which moves variable and function declaration at top of page. means we can use variable before declaration of it.

*differance between var,let and const 

var :
-it support hoisting concept.
-we can use variable before declaration of it.
-we can re-declare it.

let :
-it do not support hoisting concept.
-we can not use variable before declaration of it.
-we can not re-declare it. 

const :
-it is use to create variable with constant value.
-when we declare constant variable at same time we have to intialize it.
-constant variable value will never change on run time. 

*Math method : it is use to perform mathematicle operation.
              - provide inbuilt method 

Math.ceil(5.6) =>6
Math.ceil(5.1) =>6
Math.floor(5.8) =>5
Math.floor(5.1) =>5
Math.round(5.4) =>5
Math.round(5.5) =>6
Math.round(5.9) =>6
Math.random() =>0.012284472410839298
Math.random() =>0.8862682087572806     

String and its method 
-it is collection of character .
-in string every letter has index number.
-character index from zero index.
-in string blanck spance is also consider as string. 

*how to find index of searching string 
1.indexOf("search-String",index?): 
 -it will return index of first occurenses of search string.
 -it will search string from left to right direction.
 -if searching is not found then it return -1 result.

2.lastIndexOf("search-String",index?):
 -it will return index of first occurenses of search string.
 -it will search string from right to left direction.
 -if searching is not found then it return -1 result.

3.search("search-String"):
 -it will return index of first occurenses of search string.
 -it will search string from left to right direction.
 -if searching is not found then it return -1 result.
 -it is faster than indexOf method.

*how to find part of string from big string 
4.slice(start-index,end-index?):
-it will return partial part of string from index number.
-slice methode will search string from left to right when we pass +vew index 
-slice methode will search string from right to left when we pass -vew index 

5.subString(start-index,end-index?):
-it will return partial part of string from index number.
-slice methode will search string from left to right when we pass +vew index 

6.subStr(start-index,total-numberOf-character):
it will return partial part of string from index number.
-slice methode will search string from left to right when we pass +vew index 

7.split(seperator): it is use to converting string data into array.
        
8.replace("oldtext","newtex");

9.charAt(index): it return single available on index number

ES5(ECMA script5)2009:
1."use stric" : 
-it execute Javascript code in strict mode, in this we can not use variable before declaration of it.
-it always write at starting of js code.

2.trim(): it is use to remove unwanted white space from both side of string.

-forEach
-map
-filter
-every
-some 
-reduce or reduceRight

*propt : it generate one popup window and allows use to insert data in it.
Task: get value by using propt display wether enter alphabet is vovel or consonent.

*external Javascript

*Form Validation
*perform form validation after submitting form 
-for this we use onsubmit event 

Task1:- perform validation for lname,password,email,contact,gender
*perform form validation before submitting form 
-for this we use onblur event 
Task1:- perform validation for password,

*How to merge two or more array.
1. by using concat method
2. by using spread operator 

*destructuring: creating constant variable and storing data in it.
               we can destructure array and object data.
